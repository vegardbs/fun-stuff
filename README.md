Here is a collection of small projects involving various forms of Deep Learning techniques.

1. Study of Deep Reinforcment Rearning, using DQL to minimize energy of 1D Ising model.
  

2. Recurrent Neural Network to generate rap lyrics based on input from MF Doom (or any other artist scraped from metrolyrics).
    

3. Study of RNN, where I make it predict circular trajectories. (work in progress)


4. My solution to Preferred Networks 2018 ML intern coding tests (https://github.com/pfnet/intern-coding-tasks)
  It's still a work in progress, and will be expanded shortly.
