Here is a collection of small projects involving various forms of Deep Learning techniques.

1. Study of Deep Reinforcment Rearning, using DQL to minimize energy of 1D Ising model.

  a) See how the agent learns over time.
  
  b) Network plasticity when changing reward during training.
  
  c) How the agent makes judgements on equally good actions

2. Recurrent Neural Network to generate rap lyrics based on input from MF Doom (or any other artist scraped from metrolyrics).

  a) Boltzmann sampling of network prediction to generate diversity in lyric generation.

3. Study of RNN, where I make it predict circular trajectories. (work in progress)

  a) Study under and overfitting by using a simple prediction task for the network.
  
  b) Simulated "gravity".
