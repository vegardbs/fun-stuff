That is, the experiences where the proceeding states (i.e., $[\\uparrow,\\downarrow,\\uparrow,\\uparrow]$, and $[\\uparrow,\\uparrow,\\uparrow,\\downarrow]$) have led to a higher reward (by random choices due to the exploration strategy). Or it can simply be that those experiences has been randomly drawn from the memory more often during training."
